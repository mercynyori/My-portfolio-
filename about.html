      <p>
    I got enthusiastic with <span class="highlight">Computer Science</span> the day I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
      I was fascinated by the idea of how <span class="highlight">technology</span> could help in the medical field and 
      how I could help people live healthier lives, even if it was just 
      from a long-distance point of view or even through a screen.  I take pride in my role as a young lady 
        in <span class="highlight">Computer Science</span> to encourage other
      <span class="highlight">women</span> to pursue the same.
