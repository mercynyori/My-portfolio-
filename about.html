    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I got enthusiastic with Computer Science the day I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
      I was fascinated by the idea of how technology could help in the medical field and 
      how I could help people live healthier lives even if it was just 
      from a long distance point of view or even through a screen.

      I wanted to make something that will meet the point of need even to the sick.
      I started learning programming languages like HTML/CSS and I was amazed 
      by how I could  create entire worlds through coding.

      I take pride in my role as a young lady in Computer Science to encourage other
      women to pursue the same.

      Personally, a lady who loves fashion especially bags , I sometimes
      wish I had a personal advisor that would help me choose the right bag to 
      match my outfits.So I decided to create one! I also like traveling
      and exploring new places, it always like a source of inspiration
      and a way of recharging my creativity.
